With some more paint on the canvas, you can see how the effect contributes to the feel of the painting. Drip lines are physics-based, extending down the screen over time and mixing colors with existing paint depending on wetness. I submitted this project over a year ago but I still add to it from time to time; once I can test on a physical Android tablet rather than emulate using AVD, I hope to have the device's gyroscope alter the direction in which the paint drips move.
