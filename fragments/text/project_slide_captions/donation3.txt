This is the view the user sees when clicking on an individual post to see more details. As you might have guessed based on the content of the posts and comments, they've all been procedurally generated and mostly serve as placeholder text to make sure everything is being rendered correctly. The ability to type and submit comments and favorite posts is fully functional however, even if they aren't being added to a real database.
