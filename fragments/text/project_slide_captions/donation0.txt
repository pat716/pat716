This is a skeleton app I made with three of my classmates. The driving concept was that, similar to what <a href="https://www.acorns.com/">Acorns</a> does for investing, a user would donate a percentage of each purchase to charity. As this was primarily a UX course, there is no backend driving things but the frontend was fully functional. The screenshots here show only my contributions to the project.
