This is a skeleton Android app I made with three of my classmates for microdonations. The driving concept was that, similar to what <a href="https://www.acorns.com/">Acorns</a> does for investing, a user would donate a certain percentage of each purchase to charity. As this course was primarily about designing apps to prioritize ease of use and aesthetic quality, there is no real backend driving things, but the frontend was fully functional. We divided development responsibilities very distinctly, so with a few minor exceptions such as wording and general color scheme decisions, the screenshots here show only my contribution to the project.
